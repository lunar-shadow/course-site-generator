## Setup via installer in one step
Run the installer in your course directory:

```
curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lunar-shadow/ace57d73f501e27f023ca9c0915c38b1/raw/f55afae19e27e372e5a3ff592e28209001fe6650/install.sh | sh
```

## Setup from the repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Prepare Your Course Files**: Organize your video files into sections within a directory. Ensure that the directory structure follows the correct numbering format (e.g., "1. Section - One", "2. Section - Two", etc.), and each video file is numbered accordingly (e.g., "1. Video One.mp4", "2. Video Two.mp4", etc.).

3. **Generate the Course Site**: Run the start_service.py script to generate the HTML site. This script will automatically create an index.html file based on your organized course files.

```shell
‚ùØ python start_service.py
